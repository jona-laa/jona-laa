## Hi there, I'm Jonathan!

I’ve spent a couple years studying web development at [Mid Sweden University][miun], Sundsvall, and also finished a high-paced full-stack JavaScript bootcamp at <⁄SALT>, Stockholm. Currently I'm working as a full-stack developer at [STACCS][staccs], in Stockholm, Sweden.

I like both back- and front-end development, but see myself as more of a front-end guy. I love being able to use both logic and creativity when building projects, which is the reason I fell in love with development in the first place.

### Here's some of the skills that I've picked up so far ...

- HTML
- CSS / SASS
- JavaScript
  - Node
  - jQuery
  - React(.js and native)
  - Angular
  - Svelte
- PHP
- C#.NET / ASP.NET
- WordPress
- Some Swift / SwiftUI
- ... and more.
